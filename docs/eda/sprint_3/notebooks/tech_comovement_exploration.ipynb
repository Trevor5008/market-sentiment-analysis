    "1. Calculate daily returns for each ticker: `(next_close - prev_close) / prev_close`\n",
    "2. Aggregate by `price_date` to get:\n",

    "   - Sector-wide average sentiment per day\n",
    "   - Sector-wide average return per day\n",
    "3. Explore patterns:\n",
    "   - How correlated are ticker movements?\n",
    "   - Do tickers with similar sentiment move similarly?\n",
    "   - When one ticker has strong sentiment, do others follow?\n",
    "4. Visualizations:\n",
    "   - Time series: sector sentiment vs individual ticker returns\n",
    "   - Scatter: sector sentiment vs individual returns (colored by ticker)\n",
    "   - Correlation matrix: price movements across tickers\n",

    "- **Data Source Note:** yfinance aggregates from multiple sources (Yahoo Finance is a news aggregator, not primary source). This means price data comes from exchange feeds, but news coverage patterns may reflect Yahoo's editorial choices.\n",
    "- **Assumption:** Articles on day t align with prices on day t+1 (next trading day, weekends/holidays handled via NYSE calendar)\n",
    "- **Limitation:** Sentiment scores are word-bank based (not ML), may miss context/sarcasm"
